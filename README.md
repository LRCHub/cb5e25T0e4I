[00:21.20] Is it enough to have some love
[00:25.53] Small enough to slip inside a book
[00:31.80] Small enough to cover with your hand
[00:37.02] Because everyone around you wants to look
[00:57.52] 
[00:42.83] It is enough to have some love
[00:47.64] Small enough to slip inside the cracks
[00:52.94] The pieces don't fit together so good
[00:57.21] With all the breaking and all the gluing back
[01:19.71] 
[01:02.86] And i am still not getting what i want
[01:07.38] I want to touch the back of your right arm
[01:11.76] I wish you could remind me who i was
[01:16.29] Because every day I'm a little further off
[01:37.29] 
[01:21.38] But you are, my love, the astronaut
[01:26.15] Flying in the face of science
[01:30.68] I will gladly stay an afterthought
[01:35.24] Just bring back some nice reminders
[01:52.74] 
[01:49.22] And is it getting harder to pretend
[01:53.62] That life goes on without you in the wake
[01:58.38] And can you see the means without the end
[02:02.47] In the random frantic action that we take
[02:22.97] 
[02:07.24] And is it getting easy not to care
[02:11.56] Despite the many rings around your name
[02:15.95] It isn't funny and it isn't fair
[02:20.24] You've traveled all this way and it's the same
[02:43.24] 
[02:25.30] But you are, my love, the astronaut
[02:29.76] Flying in the face of science
[02:34.51] I will gladly stay an afterthought
[02:39.27] Just bring back some nice reminders
[02:53.63] And i would tell them anything to see you split the evening
[02:57.88] But as you see i do not have an awful lot to tell
[03:02.31] Everybody's sick for something that they can find fascinating
[03:06.84] Everyone but you and even you aren't feeling well
[03:31.34] 
[03:30.92] But you are, my love, the astronaut
[03:34.31] Flying in the face of science
[03:34.56] I will gladly stay an afterthought
[03:34.86] Just bring back some nice reminders
[03:52.36] 
[03:35.15] Yes you are, my love, the astronaut
[03:35.71] Crashing in the name of science
[03:39.67] Just my luck they sent your upper half
[03:43.92] It's a very nice reminder
[03:48.59] It's a very nice reminder
[04:01.09] 
[04:11.73] And you may be acquainted with the night
[04:16.02] But I have seen the darkness in the day
[04:21.97] And you must know it is a terrifying sight
[04:27.30] Because you and i are living the same way
